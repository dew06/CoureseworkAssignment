### I created a C program to convert a .csv file into a .tsv file.
In this program when you enter the name of the .csv file,it will be converted into a .tsv file and the converted file will be saved as output.tsv.

*csv file* (Comma Seperated values) means that the data is actually input as data that is separated by commas.

*tsv file* (Tab Seperated Values) means a text format whose primary function is to store data in a table structure where each record in the table is recorded as one line of the text file.
  
          Ex:- Enter the csv file you want to convert: Book1.csv
             File converted successfully!.
             The new file will be saved as output.tsv
